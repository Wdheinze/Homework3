# Homework3
Homework 3 was a bit difficult for me at first. Originally I did not have a clue on why my code was not responding and doing what I wanted it to
I spent a few hours trying to figure out why my code was not working and even tried to get a hold of my big brother. I finally ended up talking
with the professor and it figured out that I just had some minor errors. Once the errors were fixed I was able to code this project with ease. I 
enjoyed seeing this all come together and I found it interesting to see that one or two minor errors can really mess up a code.
